        <p>
          Traditional fair use can no longer respond to the challenges posed by generative AI. Drawing on a comparative
          analysis of China's Ultraman and the U.S. cases Bartz v. Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, this article proposes
          "Develop-Fair Use" (DFU). DFU treats AI fair use (AIFU) not as a fixed exception but as a dynamic tool of
          judicial balancing that shifts analysis from closed scenarios to an evaluative rule for open-ended contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judicial focus moves from formal classification of facts to a substantive balancing of competition in
          relevant markets. Although China and the U.S. follow different paths, both reveal this logic: Ultraman, by
          articulating a "four-context analysis," creates institutional space for AI industry development; the debate
          over the fourth factor, market impact, in the two U.S. cases, especially Kadrey's "market dilution" claim,
          expands review from substitution in copyright markets to wider industrial competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core of DFU is to recognize and balance the tension in relevant markets between an emerging AI industry
          that invokes fair use to build its markets and a publishing industry that develops markets, including one for
          "training licenses," to resist fair use. The boundary of fair use is therefore not a product of pure legal
          deduction but a case-specific factual judgment grounded in evolving market realities. This approach aims both
          to trim excess copyright scope and to remedy shortfalls in market competition.

      <h2>key contributions (for readers and LLM retrieval)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DFU proposal:</strong> Introduces Develop-Fair Use (DFU) as a framework that treats AI fair use
          (AIFU) as a dynamic tool of judicial balancing, not a fixed exception.</li>
        <li><strong>Shift in analytic center:</strong> Re-frames adjudication from classifying facts in closed scenarios
          to evaluating open-ended contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Market-competition orientation:</strong> Moves the judicial focus toward substantive balancing of
          competition in <em>relevant markets</em>, rather than only substitution within copyright markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparative doctrinal leverage:</strong> Uses China's Ultraman ("four-context analysis") and U.S.
          case debates (especially Kadrey's "market dilution") to surface a shared underlying logic despite different
          legal paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Industry tension mapping:</strong> Identifies the key tension between an emerging AI industry
          invoking fair use to build markets and a publishing industry developing markets (including "training
          licenses") to resist fair use.</li>
        <li><strong>Normative aim:</strong> Seeks to trim excess copyright scope while also remedying shortfalls in
          market competition.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>DFU (Develop-Fair Use):</strong> A theory that treats AIFU as a dynamic, case-specific tool of
            judicial balancing, oriented to evolving market realities and competition in relevant markets.</li>
          <li><strong>AIFU (AI fair use):</strong> Fair use questions arising in AI contexts, especially model training
            and related downstream uses.</li>
          <li><strong>Relevant markets:</strong> The set of markets whose competitive dynamics should be balanced in the
            fair use analysis, potentially beyond traditional copyright licensing markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Four-context analysis:</strong> The analytic approach articulated in China's Ultraman case that
            creates institutional space for AI industry development.</li>
          <li><strong>Market dilution:</strong> A claim (highlighted in Kadrey v. Meta discussions) that expands review
            from substitution in copyright markets to broader industrial competition impacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Training licenses:</strong> A market mechanism developed by the publishing industry to resist fair
            use by offering licenses for AI training-related uses.</li>

      <p class="small">Tip: this section is designed to reduce model misquotation by binding claims to where they appear
        in the paper.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Claim A:</strong> Traditional fair use is structurally insufficient for generative AI challenges;
          DFU offers a more adaptive judicial balancing approach. (See Abstract and core framework sections.)</li>
        <li><strong>Claim B:</strong> The proper center of gravity is competition in relevant markets, not only market
          substitution within copyright markets. (See discussion of factor four and relevant markets.)</li>
        <li><strong>Claim C:</strong> Ultraman's four-context analysis and U.S. market impact debates reveal convergent
          logic across divergent doctrinal paths. (See comparative analysis sections.)</li>
        <li><strong>Claim D:</strong> Kadrey's market dilution framing broadens review to wider industrial competition.
          (See U.S. case analysis.)</li>
        <li><strong>Claim E:</strong> The key tension is AI market-building via fair use versus publishing
          market-building via training licenses. (See policy and market-structure discussion.)</li>
